why did you do this to me mr cressey

## Motivation
Mr Cressey made me do this (thank you very much Mr Cressey I lost my sanity because of this)

## What I learnt
JavaScript is very goofy and sometimes you just have to run every function manually through the console

## Issues I ran into
- cleanUpGoodSquares didn't work unless I ran it a bunch of times (not cool)
- Losing my sanity and about 20,000 hours trying to fix bugs that didn't exist because of the above
